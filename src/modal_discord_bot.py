Discord Bot with ChatGPT Integration using Modal

This module implements a Discord bot that integrates with OpenAI's ChatGPT to provide 
question-answering capabilities through Discord slash commands. The bot is built using 
Modal for deployment and FastAPI for handling Discord interactions.

Key Features:
- Slash command integration (/api) for asking questions to ChatGPT
- Asynchronous request handling for better performance
- Discord interaction authentication
- OpenAI API integration with rate limiting and error handling

Requirements:
- Modal deployment setup with appropriate secrets:
  - discord-secret-2: Contains Discord bot credentials
  - openai-secret: Contains OpenAI API key
- Python packages: fastapi, pynacl, requests, openai

Usage:
1. Set up Discord application and bot in Discord Developer Portal
2. Configure Modal secrets for Discord and OpenAI
3. Deploy the application using Modal
4. Set up Discord interactions endpoint URL
5. Invite bot to your Discord server
6. Use /api command in Discord to interact with ChatGPT

For detailed setup instructions, see the documentation below.

# ## Set up a Discord app

# Now, we need to actually connect to Discord.
# We start by creating an application on the Discord Developer Portal.

# 1. Go to the
#    [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and
#    log in with your Discord account.
# 2. On the portal, go to **Applications** and create a new application by
#    clicking **New Application** in the top right next to your profile picture.
# 3. [Create a custom Modal Secret](https://modal.com/docs/guide/secrets) for your Discord bot.
#    On Modal's Secret creation page, select 'Discord'. Copy your Discord applicationâ€™s
#    **Public Key** and **Application ID** (from the **General Information** tab in the Discord Developer Portal)
#    and paste them as the value of `DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY` and `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`.
#    Additionally, head to the **Bot** tab and use the **Reset Token** button to create a new bot token.
#    Paste this in the value of an additional key in the Secret, `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`.
#    Name this Secret `discord-secret`.

# We access that Secret in code like so:

# ## Deploy on Modal

# You can deploy this app on Modal by running the following commands:

# ``` shell
# modal run discord_bot.py  # checks the API wrapper, little test
# modal run discord_bot.py::create_slash_command  # creates the slash command, if missing
# modal deploy discord_bot.py  # deploys the web app and the API wrapper
# ```

# Copy the Modal URL that is printed in the output and go back to the **General Information** section on the
# [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
# Paste the URL, making sure to append the path of your `POST` route (here, `/api`), in the
# **Interactions Endpoint URL** field, then click **Save Changes**. If your
# endpoint URL is incorrect or if authentication is incorrectly implemented,
# Discord will refuse to save the URL. Once it saves, you can start
# handling interactions!

# ## Finish setting up Discord bot

# To start using the Slash Command you just set up, you need to invite the bot to
# a Discord server. To do so, go to your application's **Installation** section on the
# [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
# Copy the **Discored Provided Link** and visit it to invite the bot to your bot to the server.

# Now you can open your Discord server and type `/api` in a channel to trigger the bot.
# You can see a working version [in our test Discord server](https://discord.gg/PmG7P47EPQ).

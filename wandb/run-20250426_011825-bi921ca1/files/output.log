Welcome everyone. Hugo Bowen Anderson, here so excited to be kicking off workshop. One of building Llm. Powered applications for data, scientists, software engineers, and whoever else wants to get on this rocket ship together, love that. I can see a bunch of friendly faces already. We'll get to this. But 2\n\nhugo bowne-anderson: if you're able to turn your camera on, I, personally would really appreciate it, and I can tell you it makes me a better teacher as well to see a bunch of faces, and to see all the, all the engagement as well, and only if you're able to, of course, and generally microphones off when not speaking as well. 3\n\nhugo bowne-anderson: I'm I'm so excited to have you all here already, seeing what you all are up to in the discord in the forms you filled in really appreciate you filling in the onboarding form as well.

I've worked in data, science and machine learning, and what now we call AI for far out 15 years now. So I feel a bit old to to be honest. I've worked in building, in education, in consulting and and devrel. Also a lot of work in devrel for open, open source stuff. 5\n\nhugo bowne-anderson: so like my, I think my, my. 6\n\nhugo bowne-anderson: my background really has been in doing scientific research using the Pi data stack that then turned into software stuff. So that's really where I come from. In the past couple of years I've been building a lot with generative AI and helping a lot of other people to build also. 7\n\nhugo bowne-anderson: But that really brings up my my background is in scientific research, in doing stuff, in notebooks, in doing my best to productionize stuff without throwing it over the wall to software engineers, which is one of the reasons I teamed up with with Stefan, who is my co-instructor and colleague and friend here, so I'll just hand it over to Stefan to say a few words. 8", 'metadata': {'token_count': 499, 'timestamp': '00:00:14.050', 'position': 0, 'speaker': 'hugo bowne-anderson', 'source': 'workshop_transcript'}, 'id': 'ef13877a-7ffe-493f-9a52-be6cad985d0a', 'relevance': 1.0}, {'text': "[TIMESTAMP: 01:23:22.200]\nhugo bowne-anderson: I love that workshop last time so much.

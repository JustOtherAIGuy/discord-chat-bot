Question	Response
"What are the key learning outcomes of this workshop series on LLM-powered applications?
"	The key learning outcomes of this workshop series are to teach participants practical, first-principles approaches to building LLM-powered applications, with a focus on workflows, iteration, and hands-on development. The course emphasizes building production-grade systems that scale beyond proof of concepts, understanding the non-deterministic nature of LLMs, and mastering observability, testing, and evaluation as the backbones of robust AI systems. Participants will also learn to iterate, debug, and adapt their applications, rather than just following step-by-step templates.
"How is this course different from others that focus on tools like LangChain or agentic frameworks?
"	This course is different because it focuses on principles and workflows—such as evaluation-driven development, observability, testing, and iteration—rather than on specific tools like LangChain or agentic frameworks. While tools are introduced, the emphasis is on teaching foundational skills and approaches that will remain relevant even as specific tools change, rather than providing a deep dive into every new tool or trend.
"Will the course include hands-on projects or just lectures?
"	The course will include hands-on projects in addition to lectures. The transcript mentions that participants will be building apps together immediately, focusing on workflows, iteration, and hands-on development, with opportunities to build production-grade systems that scale beyond proof of concepts and demos.
"How do you balance theory and practice in the course?
"	The course balances theory and practice by focusing on practical, first-principles approaches to building LLM-powered apps, emphasizing workflows, iteration, and hands-on development. While it introduces relevant tools and concepts, the main focus is on developing robust workflows, evaluation, and testing, rather than just covering the latest tools or trends. This approach ensures participants gain both conceptual understanding and real-world building experience.
"How is this course tailored for both data scientists and software engineers?
"	This course is designed for both data scientists and software engineers by focusing on building LLM-powered applications through practical, hands-on workflows, iteration, and development. The instructors have backgrounds in both data science and software engineering, and the course emphasizes principles like evaluation-driven development, observability, and testing, which are relevant to both fields. Additionally, the course provides opportunities for participants from different backgrounds to collaborate, learn from each other, and leverage tools and workflows that bridge the gap between prototyping and production.
"What is the duration of the course?
"	I'm sorry, but the provided transcript does not specify the duration of the course.
"Can you explain what “evaluation-driven development” means in more detail?
"	Evaluation-driven development (EDD) is an iterative approach to building LLM-powered applications where you continuously build, monitor, evaluate, and improve your system. Instead of relying solely on initial specs, you rapidly deploy, collect data, and use evaluation harnesses—such as test sets and automated scripts—to assess performance, identify failure modes, and guide improvements. This process emphasizes logging, monitoring, and tying micro-level LLM outputs to macro-level business metrics, ensuring robust, production-ready systems that go beyond flashy demos.
"What are some examples of an “evaluation harness” mentioned in the intro?
"	An evaluation harness is described as a script or something reproducible that you use to evaluate your system. For example, you might build a synthetic dataset and use the evaluation harness to run tests measuring latency, cost, and business-relevant metrics. Another example given is labeling outputs by hand, then using that labeled data to build a basic evaluation harness, such as a test set and using an LLM as a judge to automate evaluation.
"How do you measure success in a non-deterministic LLM system?
"	Success in a non-deterministic LLM system is measured through evaluation-driven development, which involves building, monitoring, evaluating, and iterating rapidly. You use tools like synthetic datasets, evaluation harnesses, and logging of inputs and outputs to quantify performance, classify failure modes, and align outputs with business metrics, rather than relying solely on flashy demos or subjective impressions.
"What’s the difference between fine-tuning, prompting, and using embeddings?
"	Based on the transcript, prompting involves crafting specific instructions or queries to guide the LLM's output, while fine-tuning refers to training the model further on domain-specific data to improve its performance in specialized tasks. Embeddings, on the other hand, are used for tasks like retrieval, where text is converted into numerical representations to find relevant information efficiently. The transcript also notes that you can often achieve your goals with prompting or embeddings without needing to fine-tune, except in certain specialized cases.
Could you explain how observability applies to LLM apps?	Observability in LLM apps refers to the ability to monitor, log, and trace the inputs and outputs of your system in a human-readable form. This is crucial because LLM-powered software is non-deterministic, meaning the same inputs can yield different outputs, so capturing and evaluating this data helps you understand system behavior, identify issues like hallucinations, and iterate effectively. The workshop emphasizes that robust observability—logging, monitoring, and tracing—is foundational for building, evaluating, and improving LLM applications.
